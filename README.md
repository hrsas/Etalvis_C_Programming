# Etalvis – C Programming Foundation

This repository contains my solutions to C programming assignments from the **C Programming Foundation** course on the Etalvis platform.

The focus is on writing clean, understandable C code while strengthening core concepts such as control flow, arrays, pointers, memory handling, structures, and bitwise operations.

---
## Objectives

- Build strong fundamentals in the C programming language
- Develop clear understanding of pointers and memory behavior
- Practice structured problem solving in C
- Prepare for embedded systems and low-level software development

---
## Notes

- Only solutions are included; problem statements are intentionally omitted
- Code is written for readability and correctness
- Emphasis is on understanding behavior, not just producing output
- Repository is updated incrementally as problems are solved
